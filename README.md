gone2morrow.com is an online canvas similar to MSPaint. Anyone can draw whatever they want, but the catch is that any user has the ability to delete or draw over someone else's stuff. Additonally the Canvas wipes once every 24 hours at 12am EST. 
When I first the launched the site it had around 100 daily users. Today barely anyone goes on it anymore but the site is still up!

The front and backend are both setup using Render.
